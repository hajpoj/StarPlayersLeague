			<p class="note">
				Registration does NOT guarantee a spot in the league. Due to the nature of our league format, you may be put on the waiting list. Why? 
				Our league is built on divisions of 24 players. If there is a remainder, the last division cannot be created.
				The league spots are given on a first come, first serve basis.
