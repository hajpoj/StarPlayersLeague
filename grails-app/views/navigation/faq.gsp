<h2 id="5">How many matches do I play per week?</h2>
<div class="break"></div>
    <p>You must report scores for 2 matches each week. For convenience of scheduling, you do NOT need to play them in the order they are listed in your matches view. You may play games ahead of time and report scores for more than 2 matches per week. We highly recommend scheduling matches in advance of the week they are to be played.</p>

<h2 id="6">When do our matches for the week need to be played by?</h2>

    <p>The due date for reporting scores each week for BOTH matches is Sunday at 23:59 EDT. The order of which you play the two matches does not matter.</p>
