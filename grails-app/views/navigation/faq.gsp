<h3 id="14">What is the StarPlayers League?</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
    <p>The StarPlayers League allows StarCraft2 players of all skill levels to engage in a friendly competition against others. Our goal is to provide players with a more intimate league compared to the Battle.net ladder. In our league, you may find worthy opponents, develop rivalries, and even scout your opponent's play-style before your match. Most importantly, we want to expand StarCraft2 e-sports to anyone who wants to play.</p>

<div class="break"></div>
    <p>Yes, you can have a multiple registrations in the league for playing different races at different skill levels. For example, you can register twice: one as a Diamond Protoss and one as a Gold Zerg. However, you are still responsible for completing all of your matches for both registrations.</p>

<div class="break"></div>
    <p>After you log in, click on the Matches link at the top of the page. To message an opponent, click on their Battle.net ID.</p>
<div class="innerlinebreak"></div>

<h3 id="5">How many matches do I play per week?</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
    <p>You must report scores for 2 matches each week. For convenience of scheduling, you do NOT need to play them in the order they are listed in your matches view. You may play games ahead of time and report scores for more than 2 matches per week. We highly recommend scheduling matches in advance of the week they are to be played.</p>
<div class="innerlinebreak"></div>

<h3 id="6">When do our matches for the week need to be played by?</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
    <p>The due date for reporting scores each week for BOTH matches is Sunday at 23:59 EDT. The order of which you play the two matches does not matter.</p>
<div class="innerlinebreak"></div>

<h3 id="7">What if my opponent is unresponsive to my messages?</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
    <p>If your opponent does not respond to your message by the week's due date, you may report a 2-0 forfeit on your opponent's behalf.</p>
<div class="innerlinebreak"></div>

<h3 id="8">What if my opponent responds just before the due date where there is not enough time to play or schedule a match?</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
    <p>If your opponent responds just before the due date, you may schedule the match for the following week and report the score by the following due date.</p>
<div class="innerlinebreak"></div>

<h3 id="9">What if my opponent and I schedule a match time, but he doesn't show up? How long should I wait?</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
    <p>If the opponent does not show up within 15 minutes of the scheduled game time, it is an automatic forfeit on his behalf. You may report the score as a 2-0 win.</p>
<div class="innerlinebreak"></div>

<h3 id="14">Who should report the score?</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
    <p>Only one person needs to submit the score. Generally, the winner should report the score.</p>
<div class="innerlinebreak"></div>
