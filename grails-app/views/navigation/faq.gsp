			<h3 id="14">What is the StarPlayers League?</h3>
			<div class="break"></div>
			    <p>The StarPlayers League allows StarCraft2 players of all skill levels to engage in a friendly competition against others. Our goal is to provide players with a more intimate league compared to the Battle.net ladder. In our league, you may find worthy opponents, develop rivalries, and even be able to scout your opponent's play-style before your match. Most importantly, we want to expand StarCraft2 e-sports to anyone who wants to play.</p>
